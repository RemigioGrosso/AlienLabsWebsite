# Domain Setup Implementation Plan

## Task Overview
This implementation plan covers connecting a GoDaddy domain to the Netlify-hosted Alien Labs website, including DNS configuration, SSL setup, and domain verification.

- [ ] 1. Deploy website to Netlify
  - Connect GitHub repository to Netlify
  - Configure build settings and deploy
  - Verify website is accessible via Netlify subdomain
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2_

- [ ] 2. Configure custom domain in Netlify
  - Access Netlify dashboard domain settings
  - Add custom domain (your GoDaddy domain)
  - Note the DNS configuration requirements provided by Netlify
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1_

- [ ] 3. Configure DNS records in GoDaddy
  - Log into GoDaddy Domain Manager
  - Navigate to DNS management for your domain
  - Add A record pointing @ to Netlify's load balancer IP (75.2.60.5)
  - Add CNAME record pointing www to your domain
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2_

- [ ] 4. Add domain verification records
  - Copy verification TXT record from Netlify
  - Add TXT record to GoDaddy DNS settings
  - Wait for DNS propagation to begin
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2_

- [ ] 5. Wait for DNS propagation
  - Monitor DNS propagation using online tools
  - Check that A and CNAME records are resolving correctly
  - Verify domain points to Netlify servers
  - _Requirements: 2.3, 2.4_

- [ ] 6. Enable SSL certificate
  - Verify domain ownership in Netlify
  - Wait for automatic SSL certificate provisioning
  - Confirm SSL certificate is valid and trusted
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.3_

- [ ] 7. Configure HTTPS redirects
  - Enable "Force HTTPS" in Netlify domain settings
  - Test that HTTP requests redirect to HTTPS
  - Verify redirect uses proper status codes
  - _Requirements: 3.2, 5.4_

- [ ] 8. Set up www to non-www redirects
  - Configure redirect from www.domain.com to domain.com
  - Test redirect functionality in browser
  - Verify redirect uses 301 status code
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.4_

- [ ] 9. Test domain configuration
  - Test domain access from multiple browsers
  - Verify both www and non-www versions work correctly
  - Check SSL certificate validity in browsers
  - Test from different geographic locations
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 3.3, 4.3_

- [ ] 10. Verify website functionality
  - Test all website pages load correctly
  - Verify images and assets load properly
  - Check that interactive features work
  - Test social media integration components
  - _Requirements: 1.2_

- [ ] 11. Set up monitoring
  - Configure uptime monitoring for the domain
  - Set up SSL certificate expiration alerts
  - Monitor DNS resolution performance
  - _Requirements: 3.4_

- [ ] 12. Document configuration
  - Record all DNS settings used
  - Document Netlify configuration steps
  - Create troubleshooting guide for common issues
  - Note important dates (SSL expiration, domain renewal)
  - _Requirements: 4.4_

## Prerequisites
- GitHub repository with website code (âœ… Complete)
- GoDaddy domain registration and access to domain manager
- Netlify account

## Important Notes
- DNS propagation can take 24-48 hours to complete fully
- SSL certificate provisioning may take a few hours after DNS propagation
- Keep GoDaddy domain manager and Netlify dashboard open during configuration
- Test thoroughly before announcing the new domain

## Troubleshooting Common Issues
- **Domain not resolving**: Check DNS records are correct, wait for propagation
- **SSL certificate not working**: Verify domain ownership, check DNS records
- **Redirect loops**: Ensure consistent redirect configuration in Netlify
- **Mixed content warnings**: Check all assets use HTTPS URLs
