# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will integrate real-time social media posts from YouTube, Instagram, and Twitter into the Alien Labs website. The system will fetch actual posts from these platforms, display them as Windows 95-style pop-up ads, and provide direct links to the original content. This replaces the current static sample posts with dynamic, live content.

## Requirements

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want to see real social media posts from Alien Labs' accounts, so that I can stay updated with their latest content and activities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the website loads THEN the system SHALL fetch recent posts from YouTube, Instagram, and Twitter APIs
2. WHEN posts are fetched successfully THEN the system SHALL display them in Windows 95-style pop-up windows
3. WHEN a post is displayed THEN it SHALL include the original content preview, engagement metrics, and platform branding
4. WHEN posts fail to load THEN the system SHALL not display any popups

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want to click on social media posts to view the full content, so that I can engage with Alien Labs on their social platforms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a website administrator, I want the system to handle API rate limits and authentication, so that the social media integration remains stable and compliant.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API rate limits are reached THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff retry logic
2. WHEN API authentication fails THEN the system SHALL log errors and fall back to cached content
3. WHEN API responses are received THEN the system SHALL cache posts for 15 minutes to reduce API calls
4. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL validate all required API credentials are present

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want social media posts to appear at appropriate intervals, so that they enhance rather than disrupt my browsing experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the website loads THEN the first pop-up SHALL appear after 10 seconds
2. WHEN a pop-up is closed THEN the next pop-up SHALL appear after 30-60 seconds
3. WHEN multiple posts are available THEN the system SHALL rotate through them randomly
4. WHEN a user manually closes a pop-up THEN the system SHALL respect their action and delay the next pop-up

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want to see different types of content from each platform, so that I get a comprehensive view of Alien Labs' social presence.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN fetching YouTube content THEN the system SHALL retrieve recent video titles, thumbnails, and view counts
2. WHEN fetching Instagram content THEN the system SHALL retrieve recent posts with images and captions
3. WHEN fetching Twitter content THEN the system SHALL retrieve recent tweets with text and engagement metrics
