# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on creating a mobile-responsive version of the Alien Labs website while addressing security concerns that cause "not secure" warnings in browsers. The implementation will optimize the user experience across all device sizes and ensure proper HTTPS configuration and security headers are in place.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want the website to display properly on my phone or tablet, so that I can easily navigate and interact with all features without horizontal scrolling or layout issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the website on a mobile device THEN the layout SHALL adapt to the screen size with proper responsive design
2. WHEN the screen width is below 768px THEN the navigation SHALL collapse into a mobile-friendly format
3. WHEN a user interacts with draggable windows on mobile THEN the windows SHALL be optimized for touch interaction
4. WHEN the website loads on any device THEN all text SHALL be readable without zooming
5. WHEN a user views the website on mobile THEN all interactive elements SHALL be appropriately sized for touch input (minimum 44px touch targets)

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the popup ads to be disabled temporarily, so that I can focus on the main content without interruptions while the mobile experience is being optimized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the website THEN no popup advertisements SHALL appear
2. WHEN the social media integration loads THEN popup ads SHALL remain disabled
3. WHEN the website initializes THEN the popup ad system SHALL be completely inactive

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the website to show as secure in my browser, so that I can trust the site and not see security warnings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the website THEN the browser SHALL display a secure connection indicator
2. WHEN the website loads THEN proper HTTPS configuration SHALL be enforced
3. WHEN security headers are checked THEN the website SHALL include appropriate security headers (HSTS, CSP, etc.)
4. WHEN a user accesses the site via HTTP THEN they SHALL be automatically redirected to HTTPS
5. IF the website uses external resources THEN all resources SHALL be loaded over HTTPS

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the mobile optimization to maintain all existing functionality, so that users don't lose access to any features when using mobile devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the website is viewed on mobile THEN all tabs SHALL remain functional
2. WHEN windows are displayed on mobile THEN they SHALL adapt to smaller screens while maintaining usability
3. WHEN the taskbar is viewed on mobile THEN it SHALL provide appropriate navigation options
4. WHEN social media integration is accessed on mobile THEN all features SHALL work correctly
5. WHEN projects are viewed on mobile THEN the layout SHALL be optimized for smaller screens

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent performance across all devices, so that the website loads quickly and responds smoothly regardless of my device type.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the website loads on mobile THEN the initial load time SHALL not exceed desktop load times by more than 20%
2. WHEN animations or transitions occur on mobile THEN they SHALL be smooth and not cause performance issues
3. WHEN images are displayed on mobile THEN they SHALL be appropriately sized and optimized
4. WHEN the website is tested on various mobile devices THEN it SHALL perform consistently across different screen sizes and orientations
